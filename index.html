            <header>How do I prepare for delivery?</header>
              <article>
                  <p>In order to ensure the best outcome for your new lawn the preparation done prior to installation is critical. All prep work must be completed prior to the day of delivery. If you are installing the sod yourself, these items may 
                    not be as critical but remember - we recommend the sod doesn't sit on the pallets more than about 24-hours and in some cases, with higher temperatures, the sooner you can get it installed the better. Items that need to be completed
                    include: 
                      <ul>
                          <li>All topsoil down, graded and weed free.</li>
                          <li>All sprinklers installed, working and flagged.</li>

                          
                      </ul>
                  </p>

            <header>What happens on the day of delivery?</header>
              <article>
                  <p>On the day of delivery the driver will arrive usually between about 5-10am. You do not need to be present for the delivery or sign any paperwork. Of course, you are more than welcome to meet the
                            driver if you would like. The pallets of sod will be dropped curbside, meaning on the street, in front of the house. Many customers request specific placement of pallets but unfortunately the risk of damage
                            to property or access issues prevent deliveries from being placed anywhere but curbside. </p>

            <header>How do I get sod professionally installed?</header>
              <article>
                  <p>If you have chosen to have your sod installed by our professional sod installation team there are several things you should be aware of to ensure the installation goes as smoothly as possible.</p>
                    
                      <h3>All Prep Work Completed</h3>
          
                          <p>The yard must be completely prepped and ready to have sod installed prior to the installation team arriving. This means:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>All topsoil down, graded and weed free.</li>
                                <li>Sprinklers all marked</li>
                                <li>Access of at least 40 inches to all areas the sod will be placed.</li>
                            </ul>
                      <h3>Access, Hills, Slopes and Retaining Walls</h3>
                        <p>If your yard has any hills, slopes, access less than 40-inches or retaining walls, please contact us so we can better assess how to take care of the installation. Our installation team may charge more for these types
                        of features so we want to make sure we have a good understanding of what your yard looks like prior to quoting you for the job so there are no surprises on installation day.</p>

          <section class="main-section" id="selfinstall">
            <header>Can I install the sod myself?</header>
              <article>
                  <p>Yes, you can! Follow the steps below to ensure a successful install that will give your new sod the best chance to establish itself and provide a lush, green lawn for years to come. </p>
                   
                        <h3>Prepare the soil</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Loosen the top six to eight inches with a tiller.</li>
                                <li>Spread two inches of compost (if needed).</li>
                                <li>Till in the amendments</li>
                            </ul>
                        <h3>Level the Surface</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Use a rake to smooth high and low spots so the soil level.</li>
                                <li>Soil should be one inch below the grade of any paved surface.</li>
                                <li>Water the ground thoroughly to identify low spots in the ground and then re-rake and fill in the low spots with additional topsoil.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <h3>Mark Sprinklers</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Mark all sprinklers with lawn flags.</li>
                                <li>Lawn flags are available from any home and garden center.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <h3>Place the First Row</h3>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Start on the longest straight edge of the yard – like a fence or driveway.</li>
                              <li>Place rolls of sod along this first edge</li>
                              <li>Keep off the sod as you place it</li>
                              <li>Rake out footprints and smooth wrinkles</li>
                              <li>Ensure sod is flat against the soil and there are no air pockets</li>
                            </ul>
                        <h3>Place Subsequent Rows</h3>
                          <ul>
                              <li>Cut a roll in half to start the next row, stagger the pieces much as you would laying a row of bricks.</li>
                              <li>Butt each piece snugly against each other without overlapping – tight seams are the key to a good installation and will help with the pieces of sod shrinking and also help to avoid brown edges.</li>
                              <li>Form a peak with the edges of the sod, if you push them down and they stay you have the pieces of sod tight enough, if the peak remains when you push it down you may have the pieces of sod pushed too tightly together.</li>
                              <li>Use a knife to trim pieces along plant beds and paved areas as well as around sprinkler heads.</li>
                          </ul>

            <header>What do I do with the pallets?</header>
              <article>
                  <p>One of the biggest ways we keep our prices so low is by retrieving and reusing our pallets. After your delivery is completed, our pallet retrieval team will come by to pick up the pallets within about a week.
                            The pallets must be visible from the road and not have left over product or anything else on them. They must be in good condition. If the pallets are not able to be retrieved we may impose a fee for replacement
                            of the pallets. Please ensure the pallets are in good condition and ready to be picked up.

            <header>How do I take care of my new lawn?</header>
              <article>
                  <p>Caring for your new lawn after installation is critical to ensure your new lawn establishes well and thrives. The following steps are recommended immediately after the sod is installed:</p>
                    
                      <h3>Water</h3>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Water your new lawn thoroughly. Your new sod should feel spongy and should be very wet.</li>
                          <li>No foot traffic on the new lawn for at least two weeks while you keep it very wet. Children and large dogs should be kept off the wet sod.</li>
                          <li>Do not let the ground dry out. You will need to water a minimum of twice a day and maybe up to three or four times a day depending on the temperature.</li>
                          <li>The ground should feel like a memory foam mattress, do not walk on the grass when it is wet.</li>
                          <li>After the second week, cut back watering to every other day, tapering to twice a week by the fourth week. </li>
                          <li>You should be applying about 1.5 inches of water per week during the hottest months.</li>
                        </ul>

                      <h3>Mowing</h3>
                        <ul>
                          <li>No mowing or walking on the grass for the first two weeks. The grass will be longer than normal for the first mowing. Set your mower at the highest level for the first mow.</li>
                          <li>After the first mowing, when the grass is three inches high mow it down to two inches.</li>
                          <li>Use a walk behind mower for the first trim and bag the clippings.</li>
                          <li>Grass can be cut longer in the summer but always cut 1/3 of the grass length when you mow.</li>
                        </ul>

                      <h3>Fertilizing</h3>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Fertilizer and pesticides should be avoided for at least three to four months on your new lawn.</li>
                          <li>If there is an iron deficiency, indicated by yellowing of the lawn, you can apply Ironite to the lawn.</li>
                          <li>When you do apply fertilizer, it is important you read the instructions on the fertilizer several times to understand how the fertilizer should be applied and how often it should be used.</li>
                          <li>Use fertilize sparingly</li>
                        </ul>

                  <h3>Precautions</h3>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Birds, wind and landscapers' tools from different jobs can all bring weeds and disease into your lawn.</li>
                        </ul>
                  <h3>Other Considerations</h3>
                    <h4>Brown Edges</h4>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Sod can have brown edges after being installed.</li>
                        <li>Keep the seams tight when you install</li>
                        <li>Usually this is caused by not enough water, stress, or sun exposure</li>
                        <li>Increase water, keep the soil damp</li>
                      </ul>
                    <h4>Mushrooms</h4>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Mushrooms can form with heavy watering and may appear in the early weeks as you apply more water than normal </li>
                        <li>Usually they will disappear when you decrease the amount of water</li>
                      </ul>
                  </ul>
