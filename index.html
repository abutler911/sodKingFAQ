                  <p>In order to ensure the best outcome for your new lawn the preparation done prior to installation is critical. All prep work must be completed prior to the day of delivery. This includes: 
                      <ul>
                          <li>All topsoil down, graded and weed free.</li>
                          <li>All sprinklers installed, working and flagged.</li>
                          
                      </ul>

                  <p>On the day of delivery the driver will arrive usually between about 5-10am. You do not need to be present for the delivery or sign any paperwork. Of course, you are more than welcome to meet the
                            driver if you would like. The pallets of sod will be dropped curbside, meaning on the street, in front of the house. Many customers request specific placement of pallets but unfortunately the risk of damage
                            to property or access issues prevent deliveries from being placed anywhere but curbside. </p>

                  <p>If you have chosen to have your sod installed by our professional sod installation team there are several things you should be aware of to ensure the installation goes as smoothly as possible.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The yard must be completely prepped and ready to have sod installed prior to the installation team arriving. This means: 
                            <ul>
                                <li>All topsoil down, graded and weed free.</li>
                                <li>Sprinklers all marked</li>
                                <li>Access of at least 40 inches to all areas the sod will be placed.</li>
                            <ul>
                        </li>

              <article>
                  <p>One of the biggest ways we keep our prices so low is by retrieving and reusing our pallets. After your delivery is completed, our pallet retrieval team will come by to pick up the pallets within about a week.
                            The pallets must be visible from the road and not have left over product or anything else on them. They must be in good condition. If the pallets are not able to be retrieved we may impose a fee for replacement
                            of the pallets. Please ensure the pallets are in good condition and ready to be picked up.

              <article>
                  <p>Caring for your new lawn after installation is critical to ensure your new lawn establishes well and thrives. The following steps are recommended immediately after the sod is installed:</p>
                  <p>Water</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Water your new lawn thoroughly. Your new sod should feel spongy and should be very wet.</li>
                      <li>No foot traffic on the new lawn for at least two weeks while you keep it very wet. Children and large dogs should be kept off the wet sod.</li>
                      <li>Do not let the ground dry out. You will need to water a minimum of twice a day and maybe up to three or four times a day depending on the temperature.</li>
                      <li>The ground should feel like a memory foam mattress, do not walk on the grass when it is wet.</li>
                      <li>After the second week, cut back watering to every other day, tapering to twice a week by the fourth week. </li>
                      <li>You should be applying about 1.5 inches of water per week during the hottest months.</li>
                  </ul>
                  </ul>
